\section{Abstract} 

\section{1 Introduction}

\section{2 Background and Motivation} 
In this section, we first provide background knowledge on the importance of monitoring heart related problems and one of the most common standard methods used in heart disease evaluation via the usage of a stethoscope. We then introduce our new approach on a stethoscope design and its limitations of directly capturing a range of datasets.

\section{2.1 Importance of Monitoring Heart Related Problems} 

\section{2.2 Traditional Stethoscopes} 
One of the main instruments in diagnosing and monitoring heart related problems is a stethoscope as seen in figure 2. This medical tool is composed of three parts: a chestpiece, tubing and a set of earpieces. It then functions by amplifying internal sounds from the body through two important elements: vibrations and sound waves [2]. It works when the chestpiece/diaphragm is placed on the patientâ€™s chest, where the heartbeat creates soundwaves that makes the chestpiece to vibrate. Where afterwards these vibrations make its way through the tubing and into the earpieces. At this point the doctor can begin to interpret the heartbeat and sounds. As shown in figure 3, there are four common breathing sounds when using a stethoscope which all can be interpreted when diagnosing heart related problems.
